> [!NOTE]
> Sprout is a progressive evolution of the [Masterminds/sprig](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig) library, reimagined for modern Go versions. By introducing innovative features, providing comprehensive documentation, ensuring a fully tested suite, maintaining consistent conventions across all functions, addressing vulnerabilities, and enhancing the developer experience, Sprout commits to active development and maintenance where its predecessor, Sprig, left off. As Sprig's last update was over two years ago and its compatibility ended with Go 1.13, Sprout is dedicated to promoting growth within the Go ecosystem.
